/// Spatial partitioning is different from traditional data partitioning such as
/// hash partitioning. There is no perfect spatial partitioner that can
/// partition spatial objects with extents (linestrings, polygons, etc.) into
/// disjoint partitions without overlaps. Therefore, a spatial partitioner
/// usually defines a set of spatial partitions (e.g., grid cells), and assigns
/// each spatial object to one or more partitions based on its spatial extent.
/// The spatial partitioner for our out-of-core spatial join follows a similar,
/// but a bit different approach:
///
/// 1. It defines a fixed number of regular spatial partitions (e.g., grid
///    cells), just like traditional spatial partitioners.
/// 2. It defines a `None` partition for spatial objects that does not intersect
///    with any of the partitioning grids.
/// 3. It defines a `Multi` partition for spatial objects that intersect with
///    multiple regular partitions.
///
/// The partitioning result can be one of the following:
/// - Assigned to one of the regular partitions (if it intersects with exactly
///   one regular partition).
/// - Assigned to the `None` partition (if it does not intersect with any
///   regular partition).
/// - Assigned to the `Multi` partition (if it intersects with multiple regular
///   partitions).
///
/// This spatial partitioning scheme assigns one and only one partition to each
/// spatial object, which simplifies the partitioning logic for out-of-core
/// spatial join. The partitioner will be designed to produce only `Regular`
/// partitions for indexed objects, and may produce `None` and `Multi`
/// partitions for probe objects, depending on their spatial extents.
